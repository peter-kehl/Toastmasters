Here are scripts for GreaseMonkey: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/ See also http://wiki.greasespot.net/User_script

You can install these either by downloading in Firefox (by clicking at .user.js file and then at 'Raw'). However, if you want to modify them locally, then check them out with a Git client.
